# Calendar

## Time Breakdown

The registrar states that “One MIT unit is approximately equal to 14 hours of work per term.” 

The units for PPAT are 2-4-6, which means: 
* 2 units (2*14=28) of Lectures and Recitations, 
* 4 unit (4*14=56) of Lab, and 
* 6 units (6*14=84) of Outside Preparation. 

## To Do
* finalize projects
* readings for each topic
* assignments


### Managing Time
* Only 28 of the 56 lab hours are covered by class meetings, the remaining 28 hours are to be used at the discretion of each student and can be used for requesting consultations with course staff or project work time.
* Time management is a shared responsibility, please inform Dr. Keane if you start to deviate strongly from this expected breakdown.
