My friends known and unknown, my name is Dr. Kyle Keane and I am taking lead on MIT's residential class called Principles and Practices of Assistive Technology, some lovingly call it PPAT (p pat).
 
I have retinitis pigmentosa and am functionally blind in many ways although I have some very degraded central vision in good lighting conditions.

In the class teams of MIT juniors and seniors learn to collaborate with individuals living with disabilities in the Cambridge/Boston area to create a novel piece of technology to help they're co-designer accomplish a single life activity more independently.

The class has a very long legacy at MIT and it's a great honor for me to be involved. We also have MIT OCW recording the class for an international educational disability advocacy offering at various universities and we are partnering with MIT Lincoln Labs Beaver Works which is launching an online version of their high school assistive technology program.

I fully respect how much it takes to juggle a career at MIT with the many personal adaptations that having a disability can bring with it, so I ask the following with zero expectations and full support about whether you want to engage with us.

We are looking for volunteers from the MIT community for many possible levels of engagement ranging from serving on a Q&A panel to serving as a community co-designer or giving a guest lecture about anything that brings you joy in this world.

Please send a message to ppat@mit.edu if you would like to get involved, I promise I'm putting everything I have into making this everything that only MIT can make it become and we have a massive opportunity to share our little hacks with others around the world.

I'm very much full of anticipation to engage in the touching erg meetings and getting to know new people while catching up after not getting to bed together with the many friends in this ERG after such a long pandemic, yikes luckily my passion for MIT kept it flame alive and is ready to burn red hot!!!
