Welcome to PPAT, aka 6.4530/2.78/HST.420 Principlea and Practices of Assistive Technology

++ Thiss

The units for 3.016 are 2-4-6, which means: 
2 units of Lectures and Recitations, 
4 unit of Lab, and 
6 units of Outside Preparation. 

The registrar states that “One MIT unit is approximately equal to 14 hours of work per term.” 

This means PPAT should take around (2+4+6)*14=168 hours this term, which is equivalent to 14 12-hour workdays. 
Of the 2*14=28 hours allotted toward Lectures and Recitations we currently plan to use 37 hours for traditional class time, but we will use the remaining 5 hours for final presentations. 
Of the 4*14=56 hours allotted for Labs we currently plan to use 10 hours for in-class activities, but we highly encourage you to use the remaining 4 hours to do something fun, kooky, and creative—ask us for examples or to brainstorm. 
The 6*14=84 hours allotted for Outside Preparation are specified in more detail below. 

Time management is a shared responsibility, please inform Dr. Keane if you start to deviate strongly from this expected breakdown.
